## 📖 Abstract
This project introduces inverse-designed, aperiodic multilayer graphene-based perfect absorbers tailored for the mid-infrared range (3–5 µm), an essential region for atmospheric transparency and advanced sensing. Utilizing graphene, PPSU dielectric spacers, and PbSe layers on a gold substrate, the absorbers demonstrate precise spectral tunability and electrical switchability without material reconfiguration. Employing a hybrid micro-genetic inverse design algorithm, the proposed structures achieve over 99.9% absorption efficiency, robust angular performance, and compactness suitable for scalable manufacturing and practical applications.
